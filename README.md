Project Title: Text Classification for Real vs. Fake News Detection

Description:

📰 Overview:

In my recent project, I tackled the critical challenge of identifying real news from fake news using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. This project aimed to contribute to the ongoing efforts to combat misinformation and improve information reliability.

🔍 Key Highlights:

✅ Data Preparation:

I started by gathering a dataset containing news articles. Handled missing data and structured the dataset for analysis. 📝 Text Preprocessing:

Employed NLP techniques to preprocess the text data. This included lowercasing, tokenization, stemming, and removing stopwords. I leveraged the NLTK library for efficient text processing. 🤖 Machine Learning Model:

Utilized a Logistic Regression model for text classification. Trained the model to distinguish between real and fake news articles. Evaluated model performance using accuracy metrics. 📊 Feature Engineering:

Engineered features by combining author and title information to create a meaningful 'content' feature. 📈 Text Vectorization (TF-IDF):

Employed the TF-IDF vectorization technique to convert text data into numerical vectors. This allowed the model to work with the transformed data efficiently. 🧪 Train-Test Split:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation. Achieved a balanced split to ensure reliable performance metrics. 📈 Results:

Achieved impressive accuracy on both the training and testing datasets, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in distinguishing between real and fake news.
