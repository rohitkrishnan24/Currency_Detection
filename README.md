# Currency_Detection
Project Title: Currency Detection

Description:

📰 Overview:

The growing need for accurate identification and classification of currency due to increasing globalization and international trade is crucial for financial stability. Our project aims to develop a robust system for identifying and classifying Indian currency using image processing and machine learning techniques. This system will help prevent counterfeiting, ensure accurate currency exchange, support monetary policy decisions, and aid in historical research. By leveraging transfer learning, the system will recognize various denominations and provide their corresponding values. This will benefit banks, retailers, travelers, and law enforcement agencies in promoting economic growth and preventing financial crimes.

🔍 Key Highlights:

✅ Data Preparation:

I started by gathering a dataset containing news articles. Handled missing data and structured the dataset for analysis. 📝 Text Preprocessing:

Employed NLP techniques to preprocess the text data. This included lowercasing, tokenization, stemming, and removing stopwords. I leveraged the NLTK library for efficient text processing. 🤖 Machine Learning Model:

Utilized a Logistic Regression model for text classification. Trained the model to distinguish between real and fake news articles. Evaluated model performance using accuracy metrics. 📊 Feature Engineering:

Engineered features by combining author and title information to create a meaningful 'content' feature. 📈 Text Vectorization (TF-IDF):

Employed the TF-IDF vectorization technique to convert text data into numerical vectors. This allowed the model to work with the transformed data efficiently. 🧪 Train-Test Split:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation. Achieved a balanced split to ensure reliable performance metrics. 📈 Results:

Achieved impressive accuracy on both the training and testing datasets, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in detection and classification of currency.
